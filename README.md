# Web Developer (ReactJS) Code Challenge

*Congratulations!*

We had a phone screen and we think you may be the next frontend/react guru who will join our team of talented developers. 

## The Challenge

We've tried to put together a code challenge that will test your overall knowledge of React, Typescript, Jest, HTML and CSS.

The challenge leverages a weather feed using an open source api. Create a dashboard with a 5-day forecast for user entered city. Please 
make allow up to 20 cities to be entered by the user and the 5 records could be searchable. The dashboard should allow each day to be clickable and open a 12 hour forecast view for that day. Make sure the UI is functional, attractive and renders properly on all device viewports. 

## How to submit your work

1. [Fork the project on github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to a public repository under your github user
2. Apply your modifications to satisfy the requirements 
3. Email the forked repository with your code modifications to [brian.mccullough@acquireinteractive.com](brian.mccullough@acquireinteractive.com)

## How to run the project
```bash
yarn run dev
```

Then the site will be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
